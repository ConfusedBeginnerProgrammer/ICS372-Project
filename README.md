How is the code structured? Where are the classes that satisfy the code implementation?
- All packages and java code are in the src/main/java/com/example/mainscreen
- The Abstract classes, the normal classes and the interfaces  are all saved in their package folders
- The one abstract class we're supposed to implement is saved in the AbstractClasses package folder
- The one interface we're supposed to implement is saved in the Interface folder. 
- The 2 classes we're supposed to implement are saved in the Classes folder. We did more than 2 classes. 

How does one run the application?
- The JavaFx application is ran through the HelloApplication class which will show the main screen of our app
- The MainScreen.fxml contains all the xml code for our app. It's in the resources folder under com.example.mainscreen
